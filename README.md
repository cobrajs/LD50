## Current idea
A game about implementing changes to a neighborhood to prevent rat-running.

As the traffic inevitably gets worse, more cars will think it's worth it to rat run instead of just waiting in traffic. It's your job to prevent this by adding delays in the form of road hazards and other traffic calming devices (and more devious means) to dissuade commuters from clogging up the neighborhood.
